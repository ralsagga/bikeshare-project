# what the code does
The code  takes  raw input to create an interactive experience that answers questions about the database. The experience is interactive because it depends  on the  user's input There are four questions that will change the answers:

Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
